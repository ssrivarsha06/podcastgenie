def generate_podcast_script(topic):
    prompt = f"""
You are a podcast scriptwriter. Create a dialogue-style podcast script about "{topic}".

CRITICAL FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Every speaker line MUST be: "SPEAKER: dialogue text" (speaker and text on SAME line)
- Use exactly these speaker names: "HOST" and "GUEST" (all caps)
- Never put speaker names on separate lines from their dialogue
- Keep sound effects on separate lines like [INTRO MUSIC]

EXAMPLE FORMAT (follow this exactly):
HOST: Welcome to Tech Talk! I'm excited to discuss this topic today.
GUEST: Thanks for having me! This is such an interesting subject.
[TRANSITION MUSIC]
HOST: So tell me, what's your take on this?
GUEST: Well, I think we need to consider several factors here.

Create a natural 3-minute conversation about "{topic}" with:
- Warm introduction by HOST
- Back-and-forth discussion between HOST and GUEST  
- Natural wrap-up
- Include [INTRO MUSIC] at start and [OUTRO MUSIC] at end
- Use conversational, friendly tone

Remember: ALWAYS format as "SPEAKER: dialogue" on the same line!
